# Difference between Interface and Type in TypeScript:

TypeScript is a powerful programming language. It provides a type system on top of JavaScript. It allows developers to specify data types while writing code, which helps reduce errors in large projects and increases code quality. Interface and type are two common methods for specifying data types in TypeScript. Although they do much the same thing, there are some important differences between them.

An interface in TypeScript specifies the type of an object. This is especially useful when working with classes.
Type is a flexible method that can be used for objects and primitive types, union types, tuples, etc.

The interface keyword is used to declare a type. It is usually used for object types.
The type keyword is used to specify a type. It is used not only for objects, but also for primitive types, tuples, and union types.
Interfaces can be easily extended.

The intersection (&) operator is used for type expansion.
If you declare multiple interfaces with the same name, TypeScript merges them.
Types cannot be merged. TypeScript displays an error if you declare types with the same name.

## Which one should you use, Interface or Type?

### Use Interface:
If you want to define only object or class types.
If you need to merge multiple interfaces.
When using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).

### Use Type:
If you want to create primitive types, union types, or tuples.
If you need complex or flexible type definitions.
When you want to define data structures other than objects.


# What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?
# Concept and necessity of type inference in TypeScript:
## What is type inference?

Type inference is a mechanism in TypeScript, where it determines the type of a variable, function or expression without direct instruction from the developer. TypeScript analyzes the code and infers the type from the nature or value of the data.
For example, if a variable is given a number value, TypeScript automatically assumes it to be of type number. This does not require specifying the type directly, making the code simpler and less complex.

## Necessity and benefits of type inference
1. Reducing the hassle of specifying types
Type inference enables TypeScript to understand the type of the code. As a result, developers do not need to specify the type for each variable or function. This reduces the length of the code and saves writing time.
2. Ensuring type safety
Even when using type inference, TypeScript maintains its quality of type safety. If the wrong type is used, the compiler displays an error, which reduces the potential for errors in the program.
3. Increases code readability
Type inference keeps code simple and clean. Without the need for type references, programmers can focus directly on the core content of the work. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand for teamwork.
4. Faster development process
Type inference reduces the unnecessary burden of type references in development. It takes less time to write code, which helps in faster prototyping and adding new features.
5. Advanced tool support
Type inference allows code editors (such as Visual Studio Code) to provide type-based auto-completion, tooltips, and more advanced development tools. This increases developer productivity.

## Why is type inference important?
Type inference is an essential part of TypeScript, which makes programming easier, faster, and error-free. It reduces the complexity of statically typed programming and maintains high code quality.
Developers can use type inference to speed up their work directly and benefit from the safety of TypeScript. However, it is also a good practice to specify explicit types in complex or questionable cases.
Using type inference and explicit type specification together allows for more effective use of the powerful features of TypeScript.
